<h1>PURPOSE:</h1><p>
To ensure a Community Residential Care Facility (CRCF) is not caring for a resident that is beyond the level-of-care the facility can provide.</p>

<h2> In order to cite a facility for a LOC, you must first established that there is a LOC. Section 800 – Admission/Retention in the regulation, outlines what constitute a LOC.</h2><p>
<u><b>801.C.1</u></b> – A person likely to endanger him/herself. If you are reviewing a resident’s record or incident/accident reports and see where a resident is causing harm to themselves or others; or the staff or resident(s) tell you about a resident that is threatening them or doing the above, you need to follow-up with the administrator and ask questions regarding the who, what, when, where, how long. If you find that the resident is frequently harming themselves and/or other residents are afraid of the resident, more than likely, the resident should not have been admitted into the facility. If the resident’s behavior began after admission, then he/she needs to be evaluated by a physician or other authorized health care provider and/or discharged. Some issues with behavior can be controlled with medications, so you will need to review the Medication Administration Record (MAR) to see if the resident is on any psychotropic medications and if the resident is/was getting their medications, or there may be another medical reason for the behavior. In any case, the resident needs to be evaluated by a physician or other authorized health care provider to rule out any medical issues.
<p><u><b>801.C.2</u></b> – You will probably never find a person under the age of 18 in an assisted living facility.
<p><u><b>801.C.3</u></b> – Any person needing hospitalization or nursing home care. If after reviewing a resident’s chart and/or observing a resident, you find that the resident is unable to complete any activities of daily living (ADL), verbalize their concerns, feed themselves during a meal, need two-three persons transfer, the resident would need to be evaluated by a physician or other authorized health care provider. A resident that cannot do anything for themselves, will need to be transferred to a nursing home or other appropriate facility. Residents that are having other medical issues will need to be admitted to a hospital and before returning to the facility, will need to be evaluated to see if they are still appropriate for CRCF care. A facility should not be admitting a resident whose quality of life is deteriorating. If a resident is admitted to the facility from a nursing home, you need to make sure that the resident does not have any wound care issues (decubitus ulcers and/or bed sores). The definition of a community residential care facility (CRCF) is defined in Section 101. L.
<p> <b><u>801.C.4</u></b> – Any person needing daily skilled monitoring/observation due to an unstable or complex medical condition. Brittle diabetes is a term used to describe hard-to-control swings in blood glucose levels. People who have brittle diabetes experience frequent highs and lows in their blood sugar levels, even when attempting to control it. These erratic swings in blood sugar can cause frequent episodes of

either hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), which is more common and sometimes extreme. An infection in the blood known as sepsis is an infection of the blood stream. Sepsis can become a life-threatening condition and it can strike after surgery, or after something as simple as a urinary tract infection. For some infections, multiple IV antibiotics are used to treat the problem. This cannot be monitored by facility staff.
<p> <b><u>801.C.5</u></b> – Any person needing medication that need frequent dosage adjustment. CRCF staff are not trained to provide care beyond ADL (bathing, dressing, toileting, grooming). If a resident is a diabetic and their sugar levels need to be monitored throughout the day and have their insulin adjusted, facility staff cannot make that medical decision and are not trained to do so. The resident will need to be sent to the appropriate facility in order to be cared for and re-admitted once they are deemed appropriate for CRCF by a physician or other authorized health care provider. Providing a resident’s insulin daily is not considered frequent dosage adjustment. Even if a resident takes varying dosages of insulin, the same amount of insulin is given at a scheduled time each day (e.g., 30 units at breakfast, 40 units at dinner).
<p> <b><u>801.C.6</u></b> – Any person needing intravenous medications or fluids, regular intra-muscular and subcutaneous injections by staff or by responsible party. Facility staff members may administer injections of medications only in instances where medications are required for diabetes and conditions associated with anaphylactic reactions under established protocol. Facility staff nurse may only administer influenza injections, vitamin B-12 injections and perform tuberculin skin tests. Any other injections can only be administered by a home health or hospice nurse. The resident also has the option to go to their physician’s office for the injection(s). Under no circumstances are staff/staff nurse allowed to administer an injection other than those mentioned above. If the resident is able to self-administer their medications, the resident is allowed to give themselves the injection. Keep in mind, if the resident is unable to give themselves their injection, what would the facility do? This is something you should ask the administrator. Family members are not allowed to give any medication, to include injections. (If the daughter/son is a doctor or nurse, this may be something the facility can get an exception for, but under no circumstances are family members allowed to give medications and/or injections).
<p> <b><u>801.C.7</u></b> – Any person needing care of urinary catheter that cannot be managed independently by the resident. If the resident is unable to manage the catheter, they will need to be transferred until the catheter is no longer required or until the resident is able to manage it on their own. Staff can only assist the resident in emptying the catheter, and only if they have been trained.
<p> <b><u>801.C.8</u></b> – Any person needing treatment of stage 2, 3, 4 decubitus, multiple pressure sores or other skin disorders. Resident that develop the early stages of a pressure sore or decubitus (red area or stage 1) will need to be closely monitored by home health or hospice. Staff members cannot treat decubitus or pressure sores or apply sterile dressing. The inspector will need to read the hospice and/or home health notes, to see if they are treating the above. If either agency has been treating the resident for a decubitus and/or pressure sores for more than 14 consecutive days, the resident needs to be given a 30-day notice and transferred to the appropriate facility for treatment. However, if the ulcer clears up during the process of transferring the resident, then the 30-day notice can be rescinded.
<p> <u><b> 801.C.9 </u></b> – Nasogastric tube feeding or having to be fed by a syringe or straw due to difficulties swallowing. If a resident is unable to eat solid food, puree foods, or finger foods the resident requires


care beyond what the facility can provide. Staff member are not trained to provide this kind of care to the residents.
<p> <b><u>801.C.10</u></b> – Suctioning of the nose and/or mouth. If the resident requires suctioning of the nose and/or mouth, again, staff member are not trained to provide this kind of care and the resident need to be transferred to a facility where the care can be provided.
<p> <b><u>801.C.11</u></b> – Tracheostomy or sterile care of the tracheostomy that cannot be managed independently by the resident. If the resident is unable to provide care themselves, they would need to be transferred to the appropriate facility. If the resident can manage his/her care of the tracheostomy, what happens if they are not feeling well enough to provide the care or the tracheostomy comes out? A question that needs to be asked of the administrator.
<p> <b><u>801.C.12</u></b> – Oxygen for the first time, which requires adjustment and evaluation of oxygen concentration. Staff are not trained to adjust or evaluate the oxygen concentration.
The facility shall not retain the following persons in compliance with the standards of this regulation:
<p> <b><u>801.D.1</u></b> – Serious aggressive, violent or socially inappropriate behavioral symptoms which cannot be controlled or improved in the facility. As stated previously, if the facility has a resident that has become aggressive, violent or socially inappropriate, the resident needs to be evaluated by a physician or other authorized health care provider. There could be a medical reason for this behavior, especially if the resident had been doing well. However, if the resident’s behavior does not improved after treatment or medical attention, the resident need to be transfer for his/her safety or the safety of other residents. Under no circumstances, should the facility staff restrain any resident that has become violent.
<p> <b><u>801.D.2</u></b> – Any person who has a dependency in all activities of daily living for more than fourteen (14) consecutive days. If a resident is unable for transfer, incapable of locomotion (movement), bedridden, totally incontinent of urinary and/or bowel functions, must be totally bathed, dressed and toileted, and needs extensive assistance to eat (fed), the facility shall develop plan for transfer of the resident on the fifteenth (15th) day. You must establish that the resident has been dependent before issuing a citation. This means you will need to read all notes pertaining to the resident’s care, to include home health or hospice notes if the resident is receiving these services.
<p> <b><u>801.D.3</u></b> – Any person needing the continuous daily attention of a licensed nurse. Nursing care can be provided to residents in need of short-term nursing care for issues while convalescing from an illness, surgery, or injury and the utilization of a home health nurse or staff nurse for sterile dressing changes. This care can only be provided no more than fourteen (14) consecutive days. If you observe a resident or read notes from home health or hospice, and the care has been on-going for some time, the resident needs to be issued a 30-days’ notice. Once or if the condition changes, the resident may return to the facility.


<p><u><b>801.E </b></u> Residents whose condition changes to a degree that nursing home care is required, the resident needs to be transferred within thirty (30) days.
<p> <b><u>801.F</u></b> When the facility has done all it can for the resident, including, having home health and hospice care, and the resident’s condition does not change, the facility shall coordinate with the resident, next-of-kin, responsible party, and/or sponsor, to have the resident transferred to a facility that can meet the resident’s needs within thirty (30) days. The facility must assist the family and/or responsible party with finding the appropriate facility and there should be documentation pertaining to this available for review.
